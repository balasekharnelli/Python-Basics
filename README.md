Getting started: 
         We go through installing Python, look at some of the basic Python tools, and cover the core elements of the language and syntax.

Strings and Collections: 
         We look at some of the fundamental complex data types: strings, byte sequences, lists, and dictionaries.

Modularity: 
         We look at the tools Python has for structuring your code, such as functions and modules.

Built-in types and the object model: 
         We examine Python's type system and object system in detail, and we develop a strong sense of Pythonâ€™s reference semantics.

Exploring Built-in Collection Types: 
         We go into more depth on some of the Python collection types, as well as introduce a few more.

Exceptions: 
         We learn about Python's exception-handling system and the central role that exceptions play in the language.

Comprehensions, iterables, and generators: We explore the elegant, pervasive, and powerful sequence-oriented parts of Python such as comprehensions and generator functions.

Defining new types with classes: 
         We cover developing your own complex data types in Python using classes to support object-oriented programming.

Files and Resource Management: 
         We look at how to work with files in Python, and we cover the tools Python has for Resource Management.

Unit testing with the Python standard library: 
        We show you how to use Python's unittest package to produce defect-free code that works as expected.
